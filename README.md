## Overview

**jScope** is an inspection and locator-generator tool for Java desktop applications. It is designed to help engineers and RPA developers
explore accessibility trees, understand UI structure, and generate reliable selectors quickly.

This project aims to provide:

* Fast tree inspection
* Clear property visualization
* Built-in locator generation
* Reliable highlighting

## Status

Early-stage, but functional.

Current capabilities:

* Accessibility tree exploration
* Backend abstraction (swap implementations without UI changes)
* Threaded refresh to prevent UI blocking
* Mock backend for fast iteration

Planned capabilities include locator generation, smarter inspection workflows, and improved usability.

## Contributing

The project is in active development and the architecture is still evolving. Contributions, discussions, and design feedback are welcome once the public API stabilizes.
